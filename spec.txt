Staff may make announcements on Ed regarding any updates or clarifications to the assignment.

This assignment is worth 15% of your final mark. This Ed assessment has a due date that corresponds to the Milestone, which is due earlier than the rest of the assignment (see problem description document for more details). After the Milestone, a new Ed assessment will be setup where you can make the final submission for the assignment.

Please read the assignment problem description document in Ed resources. There are also other support files there which will help you in completing this task.

When you click Run in Ed, your runtest.c will automatically be compiled and executed. You may fill this with whatever testing code you wish to test your myfilesystem.c. You should write comprehensive testing code in this file as you develop your assignment. Remember that you only need to make tests for Parts 1 and 2.

You can compile, but not run myfuse.c on Ed as it does not have FUSE support. Please refer to the assignment description document for instructions on how to complete Part 3.

However, all components of your final submission will be submitted via Ed.
